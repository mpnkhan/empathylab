# Accessibilty Showcase/ Empathy Lab
Setting up the new Empathy Lab

An accessibility lab is a facility that provides resources and tools to test digital products for their accessibility. The lab can be used by developers, testers, and designers to evaluate websites, applications, and other digital products for accessibility compliance.

The following are the steps to set up an accessibility lab:

1. Define the Purpose: The purpose could be to evaluate the accessibility of products for compliance with industry standards or to provide testing resources for product teams. The purpose will guide the selection of tools, equipment, and resources required.

2. Determine the Space: The second step is to determine the space required for the lab. The space should be large enough to accommodate the equipment and resources required for testing, such as assistive technology, devices, and software. The space should also be accessible for individuals with disabilities.

3. Select Equipment and Tools: The third step is to select the equipment and tools required for testing. This could include devices such as screen readers, magnifiers, and refreshable braille displays, as well as software tools for automated and manual testing. It is important to ensure that the devices are properly configured for the lab environment.

6. Invite employees
     Whenever people from senior leadership visit Chennai centre, we make sure they visit Accessibility showcase. Also we do send emails to team managers asking them to ecourage their staff to experience the lab. Accessibility Showcase is the final part of HR New Hire training and BootCamps for Interns. 

     In conclusion, setting up an accessibility lab requires careful planning and consideration of the purpose, space, equipment, and testing procedures. By following the steps outlined above, you can create a lab that gives a real touch and feel of how people with disabilities interact with web and mobile devices.
